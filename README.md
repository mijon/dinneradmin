The goal of {dinneradmin} is to provide a simple shiny app to aid the
administration of a formal dinner. The administration involves

- collecting food choices from guests
- assigning guests to tables
- allocating bottles of wine to tables
- managing billing to entities that send guests (may be the guests
  themselves, or, e.g.Â companies that send multiple guests)
- producing a single order sheet to send to the venue

## Installation

You can install the development version of dinneradmin using the
{remotes} package. Even when finished, there are no current plans to put
this on CRAN.
